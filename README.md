JSMail is a JavaScript Library that lets you send emails in JavaScript!

You can hook into the library by doing...

`<script src="http://jsmail.jacobgasser.com/mail.js"></script>`

To send an email, simply use the `send();` function.

`<button onclick="send('Message', 'Subject', 'SendTo'">Send Email</button>`

Where `Message` is your message you want to send, `Subject` is the subject of that message, and `SendTo` is the email address of that person.

You can also download `mail.js` inside of the `JSLib` folder.

### This project is completely free and open source. Feel free to use.
